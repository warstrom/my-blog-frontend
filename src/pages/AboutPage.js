      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Doh! Vampires are make-believe, just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos.
        Even communism works… in theory. I like my beer cold… my TV loud… and my homosexuals flaming.
        When will I learn? The answer to life’s problems aren’t at the bottom of a bottle, they’re on TV!
        You’re everywhere. You’re omnivorous.
        Weaseling out of things is important to learn; it’s what separates us from the animals… except the weasel.
        Marge, you know it’s rude to talk when my mouth is full. Marge, try to understand.
        There are two types of college students, jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.
        I hope I didn’t brain my damage. Marge it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
        Vampires are make-believe, just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos.
